# Chapter 48: Production Monitoring & Observability

Production-grade monitoring and alerting for AI-powered network operations.

## Overview

This module provides comprehensive monitoring infrastructure for LLM-based network automation systems running at production scale (50K+ requests/day).

**File**: `production_monitoring.py` (1,166 lines)

## What's Inside

### Core Components

1. **Metrics Collection** - Track requests, tokens, costs, and latency
2. **Structured Logging** - JSON logs with distributed trace correlation
3. **Cost Attribution** - Multi-dimensional cost tracking (team, project, environment)
4. **SLO Monitoring** - Service Level Objective tracking and violation detection
5. **Alert Management** - Automatic alerts with deduplication
6. **Performance Dashboards** - Real-time operational visibility

### Data Classes

```python
MetricPoint        # Time-series metric data
LogRecord          # Structured JSON log entry
Alert              # Alert notification with severity
CostAttribution    # Cost breakdown by dimension
SLODefinition      # Service Level Objective config
PerformanceMetrics # Aggregated performance stats
```

### Main Class: ProductionMonitor

The `ProductionMonitor` class provides complete observability:

- Real-time metrics collection and aggregation
- Thread-safe operations with automatic cleanup
- Rolling time-series data (24-hour retention)
- SLO compliance checking
- Alert rule evaluation
- Cost tracking and attribution
- Performance dashboards

## Examples

### Example 1: Metrics Collection
```bash
# Track requests, tokens, costs, and latency
# Simulates 50K req/day workload (100 requests)
# Shows P50/P95/P99 latency
# Projects daily/monthly costs
```

**Output**: Production metrics with cost projections

### Example 2: Structured Logging
```bash
# JSON-formatted logs with trace correlation
# Shows complete request lifecycle
# Demonstrates error logging
# Ready for log aggregation systems
```

**Output**: Structured JSON logs for ELK/Splunk

### Example 3: Cost Tracking
```bash
# Multi-dimensional cost attribution
# Track by team, project, environment
# Generate chargeback reports
# Cost breakdown by usage patterns
```

**Output**: Cost attribution by team with monthly projections

### Example 4: Alerting Rules
```bash
# Automatic threshold monitoring
# SLO violation detection
# Alert deduplication
# Multiple severity levels
```

**Output**: Active alerts with severity and thresholds

### Example 5: Performance Dashboard
```bash
# Complete production dashboard
# Real-time metrics and SLO status
# Cost analysis and projections
# Active alerts and anomalies
```

**Output**: Full production dashboard with all metrics

## Usage

```bash
python production_monitoring.py
```

## Production Integration

### Metrics Export

```python
monitor = ProductionMonitor(service_name="network-ai-prod")

# Track every request
monitor.track_request(
    trace_id="trace-001",
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    input_tokens=400,
    output_tokens=700,
    latency_ms=950,
    success=True,
    team="network-ops",
    project="bgp-analyzer",
    environment="production"
)

# Get dashboard data
dashboard = monitor.get_dashboard_data()
```

### SLO Definitions

Default SLOs:
- **Success Rate**: 99% of requests succeed
- **P99 Latency**: <2 seconds
- **Error Rate**: <1%

### Alert Rules

- **High Error Rate**: >5% errors (CRITICAL)
- **High Latency**: P99 >3 seconds (WARNING)
- **Cost Spike**: >$50/hour (WARNING)
- **Low Success Rate**: <95% (CRITICAL)

### Cost Attribution

Track costs by:
- **Team**: network-ops, security, noc, automation
- **Project**: bgp-analyzer, log-parser, config-gen
- **Environment**: production, staging, development
- **User**: Individual user attribution

## Real-World Metrics

Based on typical network AI workloads:

### Scale
- **50K requests/day** = ~35 req/min
- **200 requests/minute** during peak hours
- **24/7 operation** with varying load

### Latency
- **P50**: ~900ms
- **P95**: ~1,500ms
- **P99**: <2,000ms (SLO target)

### Cost
- **Daily**: $100-150
- **Monthly**: $2,500-3,500
- **Per Request**: $0.001-0.002

### Success Rate
- **Target**: >99%
- **Typical**: 97-99%
- **Error Rate**: 1-3%

## Integration Points

### Metrics Platforms
- **Prometheus**: Export metrics via `/metrics` endpoint
- **Grafana**: Visualize time-series data
- **CloudWatch**: AWS native monitoring

### Log Aggregation
- **ELK Stack**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
- **Splunk**: Enterprise log management
- **Datadog**: Unified observability platform

### Alerting
- **PagerDuty**: On-call rotation and escalation
- **Slack**: Team notifications
- **OpsGenie**: Alert management

### Cost Management
- **CloudHealth**: Multi-cloud cost optimization
- **Kubecost**: Kubernetes cost allocation
- **Custom**: Internal chargeback systems

## Key Features

### Thread Safety
